# android_espresso_autotest
***Tells about the setup and few basic test

This project gives you a basic idea about the setUp required for using espresso in auto testing.
build.gradle(app) contains all the necessary items to the setUp.

This will help you check three basic things in UI functional testing:
* ViewMatcher
* ViewAction -- It includes the typeText() and click() and scrollTo()
* ViewAssertion

The test has been performed on 'MainActivity' method with 'activity_main.xml', so the instrumentation test name is 'MainActivity.Test'
